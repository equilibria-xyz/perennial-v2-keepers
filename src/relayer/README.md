# Description
[Perennial Collateral Accounts](https://github.com/equilibria-xyz/perennial-v2/blob/v2.3/packages%2Fperennial-account%2FREADME.md) use intents to improve trading experience. Intents are EIP-712 message payloads submitted to this keeper which are then sponsored through a paymaster, allowing gasless trading. For the initial relese only `Perennial` will run an intent relayer but the protocol design allows for future iterations of distributed relayers profitable through relaying rewards specified in the intent signatures.


# Intents
Supported intents include
```
  [
    `DeployAccount`,
    `MarketTransfer`,
    `Withdrawal`,
    `RebalanceConfigChange`


    // Relayed intents
    `RelayedNonceCancellation`,
    `RelayedGroupCancellation`,
    `RelayedSignerUpdate`,
    `RelayedOperatorUpdate`,
    `RelayedAccessUpdateBatch`
  ]
```
Relayed intents reward relayers for forwarding transactions.
